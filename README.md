I have entered my 610 book library into this great propduct. However, I recently tried to move the library system to another hard drive. 
I copied all files over and reinstalled BiblioteQ. I moved my library system from F: drive to H: Drive. (An external Hard drive- usb)
I also copied the files to my internal disk drive on this machine. (Data - D:) now this library system starts but never loads my library.
What is my error???
